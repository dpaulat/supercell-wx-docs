Placefile Manager
=================

The Placefile Manager can be accessed from the menu by selecting **Tools >
Placefile Manager**. Placefiles give the user flexibility when deciding to add
additional features not included by default. 

After opening the Placefile Manager, the user is presented with the ability to
add, remove or refresh placefiles.

Adding a placefile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a placefile, the user will need to hit the Add button, and then the user
is given the option to add a link to a specific placefile that is hosted online
or add a locally made placefile using the button that has 3 dots.

Enabling or disabling a placefile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable or disable a placefile, the user would check or uncheck the box next
to the placefile under the E column. The user may also sort by all enabled
placefiles in the list by clicking the E.

Thresholds
^^^^^^^^^^

Thresholds give the user the ability to hide placefiles when at a zoom level
which is set by the placefile. 

.. note:: This is fully dependent upon the placefile itself, and cannot be
          changed by the user.

To enable a threshold, the user will check the box next to the placefile under
the T column. The user may also sort by all enabled thresholds in the list by
clicking the T.

Filter
^^^^^^

The user may filter the list of placefiles. The user can filter the list by the
name of the placefile or by the link of the placefile. One reason a user may
want to do this is if the user's placefile list becomes too big to search
through and they're looking to search for specific placefiles.

clicking the field of the placefile.
