Supercell Wx
============

Supercell Wx is a free, open source application to visualize live and archive
NEXRAD Level 2 and Level 3 data, and severe weather alerts. It displays
continuously updating weather data on top of a responsive map, providing the
capability to monitor weather events using reflectivity, velocity, and other
products. Extended functionality, including weather reports and lightning data
can be added using placefiles.

Future versions of the application will continue to bring additional features.
See the development roadmap for details.
